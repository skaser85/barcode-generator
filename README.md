# Barcode Generator

This is a 2d barcode generator built with HTML, CSS and Javascript in one file to make it as portable as possible at work.  No, it's not a great idea for the real world, you're right, but it's what's needed for work.  I apologize for the standards that I've broken terribly.

This uses the _qrcode.js_ library written by [David Shim], which can be found [here].
